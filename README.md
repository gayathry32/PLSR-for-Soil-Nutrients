# PLSR Model for Soil Nutrient Estimation using VIS-SWIR Spectroscopy

## **Overview**
This repository contains an **R-based Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model** for estimating **soil macronutrients and micronutrients** using **Visible and Shortwave Infrared (VIS-SWIR) spectroscopy measurements**.

### **Nutrients Modeled:**
- **Macronutrients**: Nitrogen (**N**), Phosphorus (**P**), Potassium (**K**), Magnesium (**Mg**)
- **Micronutrients**: Zinc (**Zn**), Iron (**Fe**)

This **data-driven approach** utilizes spectral reflectance data as predictors and soil nutrient concentrations as response variables. The PLSR model reduces dimensionality and enhances predictive accuracy, making it a valuable tool for **precision agriculture** and **soil health assessment**.

## **How PLSR Works**
Partial Least Squares Regression (**PLSR**) is a machine learning technique used for **predicting dependent variables (soil nutrients)** from **highly collinear predictor variables (spectral data)**.

### **PLSR Modeling Steps**
1. **Feature Reduction:**  
   - Extracts latent components that explain variance in both predictor (X) and response (Y) variables.
2. **Model Fitting:**  
   - Constructs a regression model using these **new components**.
3. **Cross-Validation:**  
   - Uses **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV)** to prevent overfitting.
4. **Feature Importance:**  
   - Computes **VIP Scores** (Variable Importance in Projection) to identify the most influential spectral bands.
